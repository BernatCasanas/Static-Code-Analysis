# Static Code Analysis - Bernat Casañas
I am Bernat Casañas Masip [(Linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernat-casa%C3%B1as-masip-a91537160/), student of the Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM. This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer Marc Garrigó. <br>
#Introduction
I will talk about how to save a lot of hours in your life analysing code in search of invisible errors like memory leaks, unnecessary lines and alot of things that can make your project a better one. I will show you two different options, on of them online, and the other one offline.
# What is Static Code Analysis?
Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining source code before a program is run. It’s done by analyzing a set of code against a set (or multiple sets) of coding rules. This type of analysis addresses weaknesses in source code that might lead to vulnerabilities. Of course, this may also be achieved through manual code reviews. But using automated tools is much more effective. <br>

# Static Analysis vs. Dynamic Analysis
I want to talk about the difference between dynamic and static analysis. Both of them detect defects, but the difference is where they find them. Static analysis identifies defects before you run a program and dynamic analysis do it after. <br>
However, some coding errors might not appear while you run the dynamic one. So, there are defects that dynamic testing might miss that static code analysis can find.
# What detects the Analysis?
1. Programming errors: logical, syntax and semantic errors.
2. Coding standard violations
3. Security weaknesses <br>
They are particulary good at finding coding issues, like buffer overflow, memory leaks and null pointers.
